// Lowest Common Ancestor of a Binary Search Tree - https://leetcode.com/problems/lowest-common-ancestor-of-a-binary-search-tree/

/* Problem Statement:
   Given a binary search tree (BST), find the lowest common ancestor (LCA) node of two given nodes in the BST.
   According to the definition of LCA on Wikipedia: â€œThe lowest common ancestor is defined between two nodes
   p and q as the lowest node in T that has both p and q as descendants
   (where we allow a node to be a descendant of itself).
*/

/* Examples:
   1.
    Input: root = [6,2,8,0,4,7,9,null,null,3,5], p = 2, q = 8
    Output: 6
    Explanation: The LCA of nodes 2 and 8 is 6.

   2.
    Input: root = [6,2,8,0,4,7,9,null,null,3,5], p = 2, q = 4
    Output: 2
    Explanation: The LCA of nodes 2 and 4 is 2, since a node can be a descendant of itself according to the LCA definition.

   3.
    Input: root = [2,1], p = 2, q = 1
    Output: 2
*/

/* Solution:
   Compare the q.Val and p.Val with current value.
   If both q and p are greater than current, replace current.Right to current.
   Or if both q and p are less than current, replace current.Left to current.
   - As result return current if none of the cases are applied.
